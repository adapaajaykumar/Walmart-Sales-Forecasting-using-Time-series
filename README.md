Introduction
Sales forecasting is a crucial aspect of retail management, helping businesses optimize inventory levels, plan promotions, and anticipate demand fluctuations. This project focuses on building machine learning models to forecast sales for various products sold at Walmart stores.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Walmart's historical sales records. It includes information such as store ID, item ID, date, sales volume, and other relevant features. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and extract relevant time series features.

Methodology
The project utilizes time series analysis techniques to develop forecasting models. This includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and trends in the data, feature engineering to create relevant predictors, and model selection and evaluation using techniques such as ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM neural networks.
